# ChatBot
This Chatbot project offers a coffee and tea delivery service. 

The chatbot is designed to respond to basic customer queries related to greetings, goodbyes, thanks, available items, payment methods, delivery timeframes, and also has a humorous side with jokes. The chatbot is likely built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and can be integrated with various messaging platforms for customer engagement.
